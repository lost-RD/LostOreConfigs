Here be my ore configs that ye of the reddits have asked for.

As of 2015/06/03 I have implemented:

* Rich, average and poor deposits of the following:
	* coal
	* iron
	* gold
	* redstone
	* lapis
* Special ore types for:
	* diamond spikes and geodes
	* emerald geodes (doesn't seem to work)
	* gold in river beds (too uncommon, needs tweaking)
	* coal stalagmites in caves

I intend to implement the following:

* Rich, average and poor deposits for the following provided DenseOres and PoorOres play nice:
	* copper
	* tin
	* silver
	* lead
* Ordinary deposits for the following:
	* yellorite
	* osmium
	* uranium
	* apatite
* Special deposits for the following:
	* nickel
	* platinum
* Any other ores that I've missed
